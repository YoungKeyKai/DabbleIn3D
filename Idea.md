# 2D Ray Casting
https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/145-ray-casting-2d

1. Cast rays starting at a player location which will just be a single point
2. Each ray will terminate when it hits a wall
3. Player can change which direction they face
4. FOV is adjustable, set some reasonable starting point like +- 50 deg either side of the direction player faces
5. Max viewing distance is also adjustable
6. Player moves with WASD
7. Optional: after clicking on the game board, player moves to the cursor location, and is placed back down with another click

To simplify, all walls will just be straight.
